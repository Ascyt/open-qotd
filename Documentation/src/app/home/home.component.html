<h2 class="underlined-heading mb-4">Features</h2>

<div class="features">
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Question Of The Day</h3>
        <p>As the name suggests, OpenQOTD sends a daily question every day in a configured channel.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Pings</h3>
        <p>You can set up a Ping Role to get pinged every time a QOTD is sent!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Custom Questions</h3>
        <p>OpenQOTD makes it very easy and intuitive to add custom questions alongside the presets, and they are even prioritized over them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Suggestions</h3>
        <p>With OpenQOTD's extensive Suggestions feature, it's easy for users of your server to suggest questions,
            which have to be accepted or denied by your staff members to be sendable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Random Sending</h3>
        <p>OpenQOTD sends a random available and unique QOTD at a time, while keeping track of the ones that have been sent already to make sure nothing gets sent twice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Presets</h3>
        <p>With over 150 presets and counting, OpenQOTD is sure to keep your members interested and engaged,
            even when there are no custom questions available.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Questions Search</h3>
        <p>In a server with many QOTDs suggested or sent, it can be hard to keep track of whether a newly suggested question is actually original or not.
            Which is why OpenQOTD not only lets you search for accepted questions, but also for questions that have already been sent before.
        </p>
    </div> 
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Configurability</h3>
        <p>
            Want to change the channels where the QOTD Suggestions are sent or disable the automatic sending of QOTDs and want to trigger them manually instead?
            These and more options are able to be configured using the bot's commands, without the need to log into some sort of online dashboard.
        </p>
    </div> 
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Few Permissions</h3>
        <p>
            OpenQOTD only requires three permissions: <b>Send Messages</b> (duh), <b>Manage Messages</b> (for pinning the QOTD if set up) and <b>Mention All Roles</b> (for pinging the ping roles if set up).<br />
            This means that you can be sure that OpenQOTD is not able to do anything unsafe to your server or its members.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Fully Documented</h3>
        <p>
            Every feature of OpenQOTD is documented in the <a routerLink="/documentation" ngbTooltip="https://ascyt.com/open-qotd/documentation">Documentation</a>,
            which is always up-to-date and easy to understand, even for beginners.
        </p>
    </div> 
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Community, Support and Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            OpenQOTD has a <a href="community" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://discord.com/invite/85TtrwuKn8">dedicated support server</a> where you can ask questions, suggest features or report bugs.

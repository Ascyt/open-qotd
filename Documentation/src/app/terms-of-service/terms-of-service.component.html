<h2 class="mb-2">Terms of Service</h2>
<p><i>In this article, "we" refers to the developer(s) or maintainer(s) of OpenQOTD.</i></p>

<p>
OpenQOTD is licensed under the <a href="/license" target="_blank">GNU Affero General Public License v3.0</a>,
which basically states that you are free to use its code, modify it, and create publicly available instances of it, 
as long as you also make your modifications open-source and release them under the same license,
and that there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. This summary is not a substitute for the actual license text.
</p>
<p>
Note that older versions of OpenQOTD (versions prior to v2.0.0, where in the git-history that license is present) still fall under the prior <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">GNU General Public License v3.0</a> license.
</p>
<p>
However, there are some additional terms that you must agree to when using OpenQOTD as a service using Discord or by any other means:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>You agree to not hold the developer(s) or maintainer(s) of OpenQOTD responsible for any damages or losses that may occur as a result of using OpenQOTD.</li>
    <li>You agree to not use OpenQOTD in any way that violates the law or <a href="https://discord.com/terms/" target="_blank">Discord's Terms of Service</a>.</li>
    <li>You agree to not use OpenQOTD in any way that is intended to harm, harass, or otherwise negatively affect any individual, organization or thelike.</li>
    <li>You agree to not send any excessive requests to OpenQOTD's services, and to not cause an excessive overload of data,
        especially not in a way that is intended to harm and/or limit the use of OpenQOTD's services.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    If we find content that you or someone else has added to OpenQOTD that we believe violates any of the above terms,
    we reserve the right to remove or modify your data, for any reason, with or without notice (as explained in our <a href="/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>),
    to prevent the use of OpenQOTD's services by you or by communities using OpenQOTD (the "server" or "guild") indefinitely and without prior warning,
    and to take further legal action if necessary.
</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right to change these terms at any time, with or without notice.
</p>
<p>
    Any questions, concerns, or want to report a breach of our Terms of Service? 
    Please let us know in our <a href="/community" target="_blank">Discord Server</a> or send me, OpenQOTD's (lead) developer, an email at <b>contact<span style="font-size: 0;">&lt;&lt;!REMOVE_THIS!&gt;&gt;</span>&#64;ascyt.com</b> 
    (when attempting to copy this email, you might encounter additional, otherwise invisible characters - those are used as anti-spam measures and need to be removed accordingly).

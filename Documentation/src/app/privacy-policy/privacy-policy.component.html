<h2 class="mb-2">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><i>In this article, "we" or "OpenQOTD" refers to the developer(s) or maintainer(s) of OpenQOTD with access to its database, and "the bot" or similar refers to OpenQOTD.</i></p>

<p>
    This document outlines what data is collected and how it is used.<br />
    In a nutshell, the only data that OpenQOTD collects is data that is necessary for the bot or its features to function.<br />
    <br />
    This includes, but is not limited to:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>OpenQOTD's configuration of the current server, including (but not limited to) select role IDs, select channel IDs, message IDs, and the guild (server) ID.</li>
    <li>The data ("questions", "suggestions" or similar) entered into the bot using "commands" or in a similar way.</li>
    <li>The feedback, suggestions or similar sent to OpenQOTD.</li>
    <li>User IDs of people who have interacted with OpenQOTD. We don't store any information about our users beside their IDs, and, in some cases, their usernames.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    We do <b>not</b> collect things like: The messages you send (unless they are commands or when OpenQOTD explicitly asks for a message),
    any replies or answers to the bot's "Question Of The Day" messages, Direct Messages to the bot, 
    or information about users who have never interacted with it, and basically anything else that doesn't have to do with the bot's functionality in one way or another.
</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right to store this data for an indefinite amount of time, and to use it for the bot's functionality and similar,
    including the usage of your data for debugging purposes or to improve the bot, such as in the use of "Presets", 
    where your data (in the form of "questions") might be added publicly without consent or attribution.<br />
    We also reserve the right to modify or remove your data, especially if we believe it violates our <a href="/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.
    However, we do not sell or share your data with third parties in the hopes of making a profit, however we reserve the right to share it for other reasons.<br />
    In other words, we reserve the right to use, modify or delete your data in any way we want, but for non-commercial purposes only.
</p>
<p>
    Any data created by users may contain things like external links, which could direct you to third party sites,
    where (obviously) their Privacy Policy, Terms of Service or whatever else they got would take effect instead of ours.<br />
    You can consider anything that is not under the bot itself, its hosting platform, this website 
    (anything under the "ascyt.com" domain or a subdomain of it) or OpenQOTD's GitHub repository to be third party.
</p>
<p>
    The Privacy Policies of services that OpenQOTD is dependent, on such as <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a>, <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>,
    might have a say in this too, so it might be worth taking a look at them as well (if you really want to bore yourself to death that is). <br />
    Point is, these dependencies and possibly others might be doing their own thing with your data or selling it to third parties,
    which is something that we have no control over. 
</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right to change this policy at any time, with or without notice. However, we do absolutely promise to never use your data in any commercial way for profit.
</p>
<p>
    Any questions, privacy concerns, or want to request the removal or modification of your data? 
    Please let us know in our [discord server] or send me, OpenQOTD's (lead) developer, an email at <b>contact<span style="font-size: 0;">&lt;&lt;!REMOVE_THIS!&gt;&gt;</span>&#64;ascyt.com</b> 
    (when attempting to copy this email, you might encounter additional, otherwise invisible characters - those are used as anti-spam measures and need to be removed accordingly).

    <h3 class="mb-2">General Usage</h3>
    <p>
        The main way to interact with OpenQOTD is using <a href="https://support-apps.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/26501837786775-Slash-Commands-FAQ" target="_blank">Slash Commands</a>.<br />
        It's also possible to use the the chat prefix <code>qotd:</code> (as in <code>qotd:questions search "hello"</code>), however this only has limited support and may lead to issues.
    </p>

<section id="config">
    <h3 class="mb-2">Configuration</h3>
    <p>
        OpenQOTD must be configured initially using <code>/config initialize</code>.<br />
        Afterwards, <code>/config set</code> and <code>/config reset</code> can be used to set the config,
        and <code>/config get</code> can be used to view it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>/config</code> can <b>only</b> be run by users with the "Administrator" server permission.
    </p>
    <h4>Variables</h4>
    <p>
        The following config variables can be set using <code>/config initialize</code> or <code>/config set</code>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>basic_role</code>&nbsp;<i>(optional)</i>: This is the role that is required to run non-administrative commands, which includes:
            <ul>
                <li><code>/suggest</code> (if suggestions are enabled)</li>
                <li><code>/leaderboard</code></li>
                <li><code>/sentquestions</code></li>
            </ul>
            If this variable is unset, anyone is able to run these commands.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>admin_role</code>: This is the role that is required to run administrative and potentially destructive commands, which includes:
            <ul>
                <li><code>/questions</code></li>
                <li><code>/suggestions</code></li>
                <li><code>/presets</code></li>
                <li><code>/trigger</code></li>
            </ul>
            The "Administrator" server permission overrides this role, and anyone with this permission can run every command regardless of what roles they have.<br />
            
            <p class="text-warning">
                <b>⚠️ Warning</b>: While people without this role cannot run <code>/suggestions</code>, they <b>can</b> accept or deny suggestions using the buttons of the messages,
                so make sure to have your <code>suggestions_channel</code> set to a channel that is only viewable by people you trust!
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

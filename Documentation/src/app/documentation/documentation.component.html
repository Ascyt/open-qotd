<h2 class="mb-2">Documentation</h2>

<p>
    Welcome to the documentation of OpenQOTD! Here you can find all the information you need to get started with the bot, as well as some more advanced topics.
</p>

<section id="general">
    <h3 class="mb-2">General Usage</h3>
    <p>
        The main way to interact with OpenQOTD is using <a href="https://support-apps.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/26501837786775-Slash-Commands-FAQ" target="_blank">Slash Commands</a>.<br />
        OpenQOTD also only acts once the configuration has been initialized, otherwise it does nothing. 
    </p>
</section>

<section id="config">
    <h3 class="mb-2">Configuration</h3>
    <p>
        OpenQOTD must be configured initially using <code>/config initialize</code>.<br />
        Afterwards, <code>/config set</code> and <code>/config reset</code> can be used to set the config,
        and <code>/config get</code> can be used to view it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>/config</code> can <b>only</b> be run by users with the "Administrator" server permission.
    </p>
    <h4>Variables</h4>
    <p>
        The following config variables can be set using <code>/config initialize</code> or <code>/config set</code>:<br />
        <i>Required fields are marked with "</i><code class="required">field</code><i>", and default values are shown using "<code><span class="default-value">value</span></code>".</i>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>basic_role</code>: 
            This is the role that is required to run non-administrative commands, which includes:
            <ul>
                <li><code>/suggest</code> (if suggestions are enabled)</li>
                <li><code>/leaderboard</code></li>
                <li><code>/topic</code></li>
                <li><code>/sentquestions</code></li>
            </ul>
            This is set to everyone by default. That means, if this variable is unset, everyone in your server is able to run these commands.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code class="required">admin_role</code>: 
            This is the role that is required to run administrative and potentially destructive commands, which includes:
            <ul>
                <li><code>/questions</code></li>
                <li><code>/suggestions</code></li>
                <li><code>/presets</code></li>
                <li><code>/trigger</code></li>
            </ul>
            The "Administrator" server permission overrides this role, and anyone with this permission can run every command regardless of what roles they have.<br />

<section id="questions">
    <h3 class="mb-2">Questions</h3>
    <p>
        Questions are the main feature of OpenQOTD, and they are what the bot sends every day.<br />
        They can be added by staff members or suggested by users (if suggestions are enabled). 
        Presets work a little differently, to learn more about them see <b>Presets</b>.
    </p>
    <h4>Types</h4>
    <p>
        Each question has one of three types, <b>Suggested</b>, <b>Accepted</b> or <b>Sent</b>:
    </p>    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Suggested</b> questions are questions that have been suggested by users, and have to be accepted or denied by staff members to be sendable.
        In listings, they are denoted using a <b>red square</b> (üü•)</li>
        <li><b>Accepted</b> questions are questions that have been accepted or added by staff members, and are sendable.
        In listings, they are denoted using a <b>blue diamond</b> (üî∑)</li>
        <li><b>Sent</b> questions are questions that have been sent already, and are not sendable again.
        In listings, they are denoted using a <b>green circle</b> (üü¢)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As you can see, the only questions that are sendable are <b>Accepted</b> questions, and they are prioritized over Presets if they are available.<br />
        If a QOTD is triggered either daily automatically or using <code>/trigger</code>, a random <b>Accepted</b> question is sent, and that question is marked as <b>Sent</b>.
    </p>
    <h4>Commands</h4>
    <p>
        The following commands are available to manage questions and are only available to Administrators or users with the <code>admin_role</code> set in the config:<br />
        <i>Required parameters are shown in square brackets (<code>[required]</code>) and optional in angled brackets (<code>&lt;required&gt;</code>), and default values are shown using "<code><span class="default-value">value</span></code>".</i>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/questions view [question_id]</code>: View all available information about a question, including its type, content, author, the date it was added, the person who accepted it, and more. 
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/questions list [type] &lt;page<span class="default-value">1</span>&gt;</code>: List all question of a certain type, which can be <code>Suggested</code>, <code>Accepted</code> or <code>Sent</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/questions search [query] &lt;page<span class="default-value">1</span>&gt;</code>: 
            Search for questions using a query. All questions that contain the query in their content are shown, no matter the type. This is case-insensitive.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/questions add [question] [type]</code>: 
            Add a question to the bot with a certain type, which can be <code>Suggested</code>, <code>Accepted</code> or <code>Sent</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/questions addbulk [questions_file] [type]</code>:
            Add multiple questions from a file to the bot with a certain type, which can be <code>Suggested</code>, <code>Accepted</code> or <code>Sent</code>.<br />
            The file must be a <code>.txt</code> file with each question on a new line. They are added in the order they are in the file, and as if added line-by-line using <code>/questions add</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/questions changetype [question_id] [type]</code>: 
            Change the type of a question to <code>Suggested</code>, <code>Accepted</code> or <code>Sent</code>.
            Note that setting a question from <code>Suggest</code> to <code>Accepted</code> works, but it is recommended to use <code>/suggestions accept</code> instead.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/questions changetypebulk [from_type] [to_type]</code>:
            Change the type of all questions of a certain type to another. For example, you can change all <code>Sent</code> questions to <code>Accepted</code>.
            Unlike <code>/suggestions acceptall</code>, running this command with <code>Suggested</code>‚Üí<code>Accepted</code> will not notify the suggesters.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/questions remove [question_id]</code>: 
            Remove a question from the bot. This is irreversible, and the question is removed from all listings.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="suggestions">
    <h3 class="mb-2">Suggestions</h3>
    <p>
        If suggestions are enabled, users can suggest questions using <code>/suggest</code> or <code>/qotd</code>.<br />
        These suggestions (=questions with type <code>Suggested</code>) have to be accepted or denied by staff members in order to be sendable, and they are sent to the <code>suggestions_channel</code> with buttons to accept or deny them.<br />
        Note that anyone can accept or deny suggestions using the buttons of the messages, so make sure to have your <code>suggestions_channel</code> set to a channel that is only viewable by people you trust!<br />
    </p>
    <h4>Commands</h4>
    <p>
        The following commands are available to manage suggestions and are only available to Administrators or users with the <code>admin_role</code> set in the config:<br />
        <i>Required parameters are shown in square brackets (<code>[required]</code>) and optional in angled brackets (<code>&lt;required&gt;</code>), and default values are shown using "<code><span class="default-value">value</span></code>".</i>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/suggestions accept [suggestion_id]</code>: 
            Accepts a suggestion. This changes the type of the question to <code>Accepted</code> and notifies the suggester in private messages.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/suggestions deny [suggestion_id] [reason]</code>: 
            Denies a suggestion with a reason. This permanently removes the suggestion from the bot and notifies the suggester with the denial reason in private messages.<br />
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/suggestions acceptall</code>: 
            Accepts all suggestions. This changes the type of all suggestions to <code>Accepted</code> and notifies the suggesters in private messages.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/suggestions denyall</code>: 
            Denies all suggestions without reason. This permanently removes all suggestions from the bot and notifies the suggesters in private messages.<br />
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note that if you want to list all suggestions, you can use <code>/questions list type:Suggested</code>.<br />
    </p>
</section>

<section id="presets">
    <h3 class="mb-2">Presets</h3>
    <p>
        Presets are a special type of questions that are sent if they are enabled and there are no custom questions available.<br />
        Once a preset is sent, it is marked as completed, and is not sendable unless it is manually enabled again.
        They do NOT show in the <code>/questions</code> or <code>/suggestions</code> listings, and they are not editable, however
        it is possible to disable them individually by manually marking them as completed using <code>/presets setactive</code>.<br />
        Just like questions, they get sent in a random order and not as a queue.
    </p>
    <h4>Commands</h4>
    <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/presets list &lt;type&gt; &lt;page<span class="default-value">1</span>&gt;</code>: 
            List all presets of a certain type, which can be <code>Active</code> or <code>Completed</code>.<br />
            If no type is specified, all presets are shown.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/presets setactive [preset_id] [active]</code>: 
            Set a preset to be <code>Active</code> or <code>Completed</code>. If a preset is active, it is sent if there are no custom questions available.<br />
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/presets reset</code>: 
            Reset all presets to be active. This makes all presets sendable if there are no custom questions available.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/presets suggest</code>: 
            Suggest a preset to be added to the bot globally. This is similar to <code>/feedback</code>, only that it is specifically for suggesting presets.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="commands">
    <h3 class="mb-2">Other Commands</h3>
    <p>
        The following commands are other commands, most of which are available to everyone with the <code>basic_role</code> role (with a notable exception being <code>/trigger</code> being admin-only):<br />
        <i>Required parameters are shown in square brackets (<code>[required]</code>) and optional in angled brackets (<code>&lt;required&gt;</code>), and default values are shown using "<code><span class="default-value">value</span></code>".</i>

            (questions that have been accepted and sent as QOTD).<br />
            This is the same as <code>/lb</code>.

        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/topic &lt;include_presets<span class="default-value">true</span>&gt;</code>:
            Send a random question of type <code>Sent</code> to the current channel. <br />
            This can be used to revive a dead chat and find an interesting topic to talk about.<br />
            Using a button below the message, the person who ran the command can reroll the question as many times as they want.<br />
            This command is purely visual, and does not alter the questions in any way, and the same topic can be sent multiple times. 
        </li>

            <code>/sentquestions &lt;page<span class="default-value">1</span>&gt;</code>: 
            List all questions that have been sent as QOTD.<br />
            This is the same as <code>/questions list type:Sent</code>, except that it is available to all users with the <code>basic_role</code> (not just admins).

        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/suggest [question]</code>: 
            Suggest a question to be added to the server, which will create a <code>Suggested</code> question that has to be accepted or denied by staff members to be sendable.<br />

        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/trigger</code>: 
            Trigger a QOTD manually. This sends a random available QOTD, as if it was sent automatically.<br />
            This command is only available to Administrators or users with the <code>admin_role</code> set in the config.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <code>/feedback [message]</code>: 
            Send feedback to the bot's developer. <br />

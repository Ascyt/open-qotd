<h2 class="mb-2">About</h2>

<p>
    This is a little project I made, originally for a server called ArtCord (which you can join <a href="https://discord.gg/ArtCord" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://discord.gg/ArtCord">here</a>)
    but I later decided to rewrite the older version (that also only worked on ArtCord) and to make it public so that others can use it as well.

<p>
    I noticed that there was no really good Question Of The Day bot that allowed users to suggest questions and had some of the features I wanted, so I decided to make one myself.<br />
    At first I was considering adding a paywall to some of the features, so that I can finally earn money with some of my projects,
    but I decided against it because I didn't want to limit some features to a stupid online subscription or something, 
    and because that, realistically, I wouldn't have made much money with it anyway. 
    I mean who really wants to pay a monthly subscription for a Discord bot that sends question of the days? I sure as hell wouldn't. 
</p>
<p>
    However, please, if you enjoy this bot or other projects I have made, consider making a small <a href="https://ascyt.com/donate" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://ascyt.com/donate">donation</a>,<br />
    or at least sharing the bot with your friends or making a suggestion in your favorite Discord server to add it.<br />
    It honestly makes me sad to see that the projects I spend weeks or months on barely get noticed by anyone, so really, any kind of support is appreciated.

    there might even be a small easter egg or something hidden somewhere, who knows...

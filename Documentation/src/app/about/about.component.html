<h2 class="mb-2">About</h2>
<p>
    I noticed that there was no really good Question Of The Day bot that allowed users to suggest questions and had some of the features I wanted, so I decided to make one myself.<br />
    At first I was considering adding a paywall to some of the features, so that I can finally earn money with some of my projects,
    but I decided against it because I didn't want to limit some features to a stupid online subscription or something, 
    and because that, realistically, I wouldn't have made much money with it anyway. 
    I mean who really wants to pay a monthly subscription for a Discord bot that sends daily messages? I sure as hell wouldn't.

    What used to be a simple project originally hard-coded for a single server (which is called ArtCord, you can join it <a href="https://discord.gg/kQ6UNYyhAR" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://discord.gg/kQ6UNYyhAR">here</a>) has now grown to be used over 1,500 different servers and counting. I love working on this project, and I have so many plans on things I want to add in the future (check the <a href="https://github.com/Ascyt/open-qotd/issues" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://github.com/Ascyt/open-qotd/issues">Issues</a> for some of the things I'm planning on), and I am especially greatful for the support that this community has been giving me.

    I'm a hobbyist programmer from Austria and, at the time of writing this in October 2025, I'm 18 years old. Other than this Discord bot there are also other projects I'm passionate about, such as a <a href="https://ascyt.itch.io/4d-sim" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://ascyt.itch.io/4d-sim">4D simulator</a> or my <a href="https://ascyt.com/" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://ascyt.com/">personal website</a> (which might even have a small easter egg or something hidden somewhere, who knows...)

    If you enjoy this bot or other projects I have made, consider making a small <a href="https://ascyt.com/donate" target="_blank" ngbTooltip="https://ascyt.com/donate">donation</a>,
    <a routerLink="/vote">voting for the bot</a> on Discord bot lists, or sharing the bot with your friends or making a suggestion in your favorite Discord server to add it. Any support is appreciated, thank you ♡
